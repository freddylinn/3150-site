                <h2>Colorado Animals</h2>
                <p>
                    Colorado has lots of cool animals, whether it be bighorn sheep or elk.
                    Wow. Such cool animals. I'm already running out of text to type here.
                    Just gotta get it to a normal paragraph length to make the design look correct.
                    You can see a lot of elk in Rocky Mountain National Park. Pretty cool stuff.
                    This is now my stream of consciousness until I get to the length it needs to be.

                    Elk are kinda like deer but also not. They're pretty big and as aforementioned,
                    you can see a lot of them in Rocky Mountain National Park, located in Estes Park,
                    Colorado. Also the place where the Stanley hotel from the hit movie The Shining is.
                    Wowza. So much Colorado history on this responsive and accessible page.

                <h2>Wolves</h2>
                <p>Pretty sure we have wolves here right? Who knows. I feel like I saw
                    them in a nature documentary. Wolves are like dogs but big and stuff.
                    Ain't that crazy? Big ol dogs. Wow.

                <h2>Bighorn Sheep</h2>
                <p>The one thing that bighorn sheep have that holds them back is their
                    association with Colorado State University, located in Fort Collins, Colorado.
                    Fort Collins is actually pretty cool. BUT THE RAMS GOT NOTHING ON THE BUFFS.
                    I WAS STRESSING FOR MY LIFE DURING THE OVERTIME GAME BETWEEN CU AND CSU.
