            <h3>Principles of Universal Design</h3>
            <p>The Centre for Excellence in Universal Design defines universal design as 
                "the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used 
                to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability."
                This serves as a strong foundation for what we consider universal design to be as a concept. These pages
                in particular will focus on universal design on the web, but it can be extended to every part of everyday life.
                The core idea of designing products that are immediately accessible to all users can guide designers toward a
                common goal.

            <h3>Tools for Digital Universal Design</h3>
            <p>Assistive technologies have revolutionized how users with disabilities can interact with their computers.
                These tools offer a wide range of possibilities when set up correctly. Below is a list of some assistive technologies or concepts
                that help improve the digital experience for users with disabilities.
