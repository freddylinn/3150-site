            <h3>Principles of Universal Design</h3>
            <p>The Centre for Excellence in Universal Design defines universal design as 
                "the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used 
                to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability."
                This serves as a strong foundation for what we consider universal design to be as a concept. These pages
                in particular will focus on universal design on the web, but it can be extended to every part of everyday life.
                The core idea of designing products that are immediately accessible to all users can guide designers toward a
                common goal. There are seven commonly used principles that can help achieve this.
            </p>
            <ol id="principles">
                <li>Equitable Use</li>
                <li>Flexibility in Use</li>
                <li>Simple and Intuitive Use</li>
                <li>Perceptible Information</li>
                <li>Tolerance for Error</li>
                <li>Low Physical Effort</li>
                <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use</li>
            </ol>
            <p>An excellent reference for universal design is the book <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman. The book has multiple iterations,
            but each one encompasses imperative concepts for design that will automatically make sense without the user having to even think about it. These include
            affordances, which are aspects of the design that are perceivable possibilities by the user. Constraints are limits put on what the user can do to prevent user error.
            Feedback is the concept of a product responding in some way when the user interacts with it correctly or incorrectly. All three of these can be applied to website design,
            and Norman covers many more topics in his book.

            <h3>Tools for Digital Universal Design</h3>
            <p>Assistive technologies have revolutionized how users with disabilities can interact with their computers.
                These tools offer a wide range of possibilities when set up correctly. Below is a list of some assistive technologies or concepts
                that help improve the digital experience for users with disabilities.
