        <h2>Why is Universal Design Important?</h2>

            <h3>Web Demographics</h3>
            <p>According to the U.S Census, over <strong>41 million</strong> people in the U.S alone have some kind of disability. Various disabilities 
            can lead to challenges in properly accessing websites if they are not coded correctly. For example, blind users utilize screen readers to read
            page content, and if a page isn't semantic, they won't be able to consume the same content as other users. Users with motor impairments may need
            to navigate entirely with their keyboards, and this requires proper structuring from the website itself. When a website is properly put together with
            semantic, accessible practices, everyone can enjoy and interact with its content. Otherwise, one or more groups are entirely excluded from valuable information.</p>
            <img src="./chart.png" alt="chart depicting the prevalence of disabilites across different parts of the US" id="chart">
            <p>On top of the need for general accessibility, the way people interact with the internet has become so diverse that responsiveness is more important than ever. 
                Around 15% of Americans only have access to the internet through their mobile device (Pew Research Center), so a dedicated mobile-first design is essential. There are so many factors
                that play into a user's situation, and many of them can be addressed just by applying best practices. The internet has become ubiquitous in everyday life, so it is
                crucial that everyone has equitable access to what it has to offer.

            <h3>Benefits for Everyone</h3>
            <p>One of the best parts about universal design is embedded in its name: the universal benefits. Implementing practices to improve accessibility
                enhances the experience for users with disabilities, but also enhances everyone's experience! Websites that are properly structured and semantically defined
                are easy to navigate and understand for anyone who visits the site. When websites follow expected standards, they are immediately understandable by uesrs based
                on past experiences. Imagine if you every time you played a new computer game, the controls had a completely different layout.
                You would try to press "spacebar" to jump, but jump might be "k" or "5" or "p" and you'd have no idea how to find it. This is what it's like when websites
                don't follow the established standards.
