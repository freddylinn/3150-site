        <h2>How Do We Achieve Universal Design on the Web?</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>HTML5 and CSS</h3>
            <p> <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> are core web technologies that come with a diverse set of tools to achieve universal design.
                The introduction of HTML5 in 2008 revolutionized semantic HTML. MDN Web Docs explains semantic HTML via an h1 tag: 
                "In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning)
                 of 'a top level heading on your page." HTML defines the content itself. An important idea to keep in mind with HTML5 is to be as specific as possible when structuring
                 content. A common pitfall is that developers only use the div or span tags for content, but these have no semantic value.
                 Developers can use the section tag to define sections, h2 or h3 tags to define section headers, p tags to define paragraphs, and so much more.
                 A comprehensive list can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">here</a>. Proper semantic tags help screen
                 readers understand a website and navigate it accordingly. Example code is below, first showing proper semantics and then vague html.

    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Section Title&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some Paragraph Text&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

            <p>CSS handles the styling of content and is crucial for universal design. CSS can make websites mobile-first and responsive, meaning you can define
                styles for mobile devices initially and then use media queries to define styles for desktop devices. This allows for different styling depending on
                screen size so that designers can provide smooth experiences regardless of device. Designers can also take advantage of 
                CSS Grid and Flexbox to perfect their layouts. Color and font controls are imperative for providing proper contrast and sizing so that users with vision impairments
                like colorblindness or blurry vision can clearly see the content. The "em" and "rem" units size text according to a user's font preferences. You can also
                set certain items to only be read by screen readers, or to be ignored by screen readers.

            <h3>Validation Tools</h3>
            <p> Validation tools can help spot errors in code that would go against best practices in accessibility. They can test the HTML itself,
                color contrast, semantics, and more. Certain validation tools will even give advice on how to improve the accessibility of your site on top
                of pointing out errors. These include: W3C HTML Validator, Google Lighthouse (comprehensive), WAVE (contrast and structuring errors), and more.

            <h3>Helpful Features</h3>
            <p>On top of proper structuring, you can incorporate some helpful tricks with HTML and CSS or with any digital media you produce. "Skip navigation" buttons can make the experience
                much smoother for users with screen readers so that they don't have to hear the navigation every time they change pages. It is fairly easy to implement in HTML and CSS and an example implementation
                is shown below, assuming you have a main HTML tag with the id "maincontent". The first code block is the HTML, which can be put at the top of your body above the header, and the second code block is the css
                which can be implemented in your CSS stylesheet file.
            </p>
<pre>
<h4>HTML</h4>
<code>
&lt;a class="skip-link" href="#maincontent"&gt;Skip&lt;/a&gt;
</code>


<h4>CSS</h4>
<code>
.skip-link {
    background: black;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: .25rem;
    position: absolute;
    transform: translateY(-200%);
    transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.skip-link:focus {  
    transform: translateY(0%);
}
</code>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, it's always important to ensure that a video you produce has captions for users with hearing impairments. Adobe has numerous color picking tools
            that will allow you to pick high-contrast color schemes along with options that are suitable for users with colorblindness. Small design changes that are easy to implement
            can make a huge difference for certain users, and benefit everyone even if it's just a slight effect. This will compound over time and produce a high-quality product.
