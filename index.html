            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Freddy. I'm a junior in computer science at CU Boulder. I enjoy all kinds of programming,
                but have mainly focused on web development. This makes me excited to learn universal design so that
                I can make my websites more accessible and a better experience for everyone that uses them. I am also
                part of a web development club here at CU called Blueprint Boulder so I hope to apply this knowledge 
                towards all of our annual projects as well as the club website. Outside of classes, I enjoy climbing,
                skiing, surfing, and anything else outdoors. 
            </p>
            <p>So far I've learned a lot more about accessible web design. This includes labeling sections, using
                semantic HTML for the correct purposes, and more. This has helped me learn fundamental concepts that I can
                apply in all future projects. It has also given me the opportunity to tell teammates and organizations about these
                best practices in hopes of making the web more accessible. HTML5 is a powerful tool that can make navigating websites
                much easier for all users.
            </p>
