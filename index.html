                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Freddy. I'm a junior in computer science at CU Boulder. I enjoy all kinds of programming,
                    but have mainly focused on web development. This makes me excited to learn universal design so that
                    I can make my websites more accessible and a better experience for everyone that uses them. I am also
                    part of a web development club here at CU called Blueprint Boulder so I hope to apply this knowledge
                    towards all of our annual projects as well as the club website. Outside of classes, I enjoy climbing,
                    skiing, surfing, and anything else outdoors.
                </p>
                <p>So far I've learned a lot more about accessible web design. This includes labeling sections, using
                    semantic HTML for the correct purposes, and more. This has helped me learn fundamental concepts that I can
                    apply in all future projects. It has also given me the opportunity to tell teammates and organizations about these
                    best practices in hopes of making the web more accessible. HTML5 is a powerful tool that can make navigating websites
                    much easier for all users.

                <h2>My Favorite Projects</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite projects at CU Boulder was in my Intro to Cybersecurity class. For this project, we were tasked with
                    testing student sites from the intro to web development course for vulnerabilities. This gave me the opportunity to apply the
                    skills I'd learned in a controlled environment and brainstorm how any vulnerabilities could be patched. It felt like a learning
                    experience for both myself and the students whose website I tested, so I liked how it was mutually beneficial. It also felt close
                    to a real world penetration testing scenario.

                <p>One of my favorite projects in my universal design course was the semantic wiki. It taught me a lot about how to properly structure a page.
